              Hi! I'm Andrew Sanchez. A Full-Stack Software Engineer who has
              experience with various Front End and Backend Technologies. The
              path that has led me to become a software engineer began when I
              was attending school at California State University, Monterey Bay.
              Throughout my time at CSUMB I've had a chance to explore
              everything in computer science; From exploring multiple
              programming languages to working with diverse
              frameworks/libraries. Since graduating I have had the chance to
              build and deploy various applications using the latest
              technologies. As an engineer, I'm always looking to learn new
              skill sets that allow me become a more versatile and knowledgeable
              software engineer.
