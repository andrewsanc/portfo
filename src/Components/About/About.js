              I'm Andrew Sanchez, a Software Engineer who has experience with a
              variety of frontend and backend technologies. My path began when I
              took my first CS course in{" "}
              <span className='project-tag'>Java</span> and was instructed to
              build my first application. Since then, I've had a chance to
              explore everything in computer science; From doing data analysis
              with <span className='project-tag'>Python</span> to building
              beautiful user interfaces with{" "}
              <span className='project-tag'>React</span> to building scalable
              APIs with <span className='project-tag'>Node.JS</span>/
              <span className='project-tag'>Express</span>. As an engineer, I'm
              always looking to learn new skill sets that allow me to become a
              more versatile and knowledgeable software engineer.
