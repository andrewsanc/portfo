              I'm Andrew Sanchez, a Software Engineer who has experience with a
              variety of frontend and backend technologies. My path began when I
              took my first CS course in Java and was instructed to build my
              first application. Since then, I've had a chance to explore
              everything in computer science; From doing data analysis with
              Python to building beautiful user interfaces with React to
              building scalable APIs with Node.js/Express. As an engineer, I'm
              always looking to learn new skill sets that allow me to become a
              more versatile and knowledgeable software engineer.
