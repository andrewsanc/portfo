              Hi! I'm Andrew Sanchez. A Full-Stack Software Engineer who has
              experience with various Front End and Backend Technologies. My
              path that has led me to become a software engineer began when I
              was attending school at Caliornia State University, Monterey Bay.
              Throughout my time at CSUMB I've had a chance to explore
              everything in computer science; From different programming
              languages to various frameworks/libraries. Since graduating I've
              had the chance to build and deploy various applications using the
              latest technologies. As engineer, I'm always looking to learn new
              skill sets that allow me become a more versatile and knowledge
              software engineer.
